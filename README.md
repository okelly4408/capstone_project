Using GANs to create abstract art
The image set I am working with is too large to upload here but has been resized and formated for use in a CNN requiring 128x128 pixel resolution.
I would like to increase the allowed resolution of these images and will probably have to migrate to tensor flow to accomplish this.
Currently working with code pieced together from a variety of places to get some images generated before moving on. 
All work is in pytorch.
